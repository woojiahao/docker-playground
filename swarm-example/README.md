# Swarms
A swarm is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster. Once the swarm is created, all commands are executed by a swarm manager. The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual. Upon joining a swarm, the machines are referred to as nodes.

Swarm managers employ different strategies to run containers.
